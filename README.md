## Welcome to a modified version Udacity's Self-Driving Car Simulator 

This simulator was built for [Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree](https://udacity.com/drive), to teach students how to train cars how to navigate road courses using deep learning. See more [project details here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3).

And changes were made, adding the ability to collect segmented photos, and create a reinforcement learning based autonomous vehicle.

This is done through creating a reward function, reset systems and duplicating the world and the actions by the actor to be clone into a segmented world.
